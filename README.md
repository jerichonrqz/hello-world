# hello-world
This is just me starting out. 
I started out dancing then decided to study how to make music to see if I could make a living with it. I lost track of the where that path was taking me and landed on Kinesiology instead. After graduating, I found out too late that this was not the career path that I could see myself being happy in so here I am now, trying to learn how to code in order to make videos games.
